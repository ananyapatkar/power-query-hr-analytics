Power BI – Data Transformation using Power Query
Dataset: HR Analytics

1. The HR Analytics dataset was imported into Power BI Desktop using the Get Data option.

2. Power Query Editor was opened to perform data cleaning and transformation operations.

3. Unnecessary columns such as EmployeeCount, EmployeeNumber, Over18, and StandardHours were removed to reduce redundancy.

4. Column headers were renamed to improve readability and understanding.

5. Missing values were checked using filters and handled appropriately by replacing null values with meaningful defaults.

6. Data types were verified and corrected. Numeric columns such as Age, Monthly Income, and Total Working Years were set to whole numbers, while categorical columns were set as text.

7. The AgeGroup column was split into Start Age and End Age using the split by delimiter option.

8. Conditional columns were created:
   - Age Category (Young, Mid Age, Senior) based on Age.
   - Salary Band (Low, Medium, High) based on Monthly Income.

9. All transformations were applied and the cleaned data was loaded into the Power BI data model.

10. Multiple visualizations were created using the transformed data to analyze employee attrition, salary distribution, and workforce patterns.
